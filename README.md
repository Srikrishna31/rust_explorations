# Rust

Rust is a modern language aimed at both Systems programming and high performance areas. It doesn't use GC unlike other modern languages, and has safety, security and performance guarantees inbuilt.
As such it is gaining traction, and is fast becoming a viable alternative to embedded systems programming, with modern features. Below are some useful links for learning Rust:

A good book to learn backend development in Rust:
<https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html> and its github repo: <https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production>

My adaptation of the repo is here: <https://github.com/Srikrishna31/zero2prod>

For people with more mathematical bent of mind can try to adapt a C++ raytracer by following the three part series: <https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html>

My repo of raytracer written in Rust is here: <https://github.com/Srikrishna31/raytracing>

A more hands-on approach to learning rust: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings>
This presents as code that is failing to compile, and your job is to fix the errors to get it to compile, and in the process learning rust.

## State machine design explorations

State machines are an important design pattern which are encountered frequently in various domains of software. From web servers/apps to embedded applications, they are everywhere and help us solve important problems in a clean 
and neat way if designed rightly. Taken from [Hoverbear's blog](https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/), following are some of the goals of a good state machine implementation:

1. Can only be in one state at a time.
2. Each state should be able to have its own associated values if required.
3. Transitioning between states should have well defined semantics
4. It should be possible to have some level of shared state.
5. Only explicitly defined transitions should be permitted.
6. Changing from one state to another should consume the state so it can no longer be used.
7. We shouldn't need to allocate memory for all states. No more than largest sized state certainly.
8. Any error messages should be easy to understand.
9. We shouldn't need to resort to heap allocations to do this. Everything should be possible on the stack.
10. The type system should be harnessed to our greatest ability.
11. As many errors as possible should be at compile time.

The below links provide various explorations done by different people with above requirements in mind (and probably relaxing some of them for flexibility), which lead to different design possibilities:
