# Rust
Rust is a modern language aimed at both Systems programming and high performance areas. It doesn't use GC unlike other modern languages, and has safety, security and performance guarantees inbuilt.
As such it is gaining traction, and is fast becoming a viable alternative to embedded systems programming, with modern features. Below are some useful links for learning Rust:

A good book to learn backend development in Rust:
https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html and its github repo: https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production

My adaptation of the repo is here: https://github.com/Srikrishna31/zero2prod

For people with more mathematical bent of mind can try to adapt a C++ raytracer by following the three part series: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

My repo of raytracer written in Rust is here: https://github.com/Srikrishna31/raytracing

A more hands-on approach to learning rust: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
This presents as code that is failing to compile, and your job is to fix the errors to get it to compile, and in the process learning rust.

Article about ownership and move semantics comparison in Rust and C++: https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/c-rust-interior-mutability-moving-and-ownership

A good series explaining implementing Linked Lists in Rust, en-route explaining Ownership and Borrow semantics: https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/
